Jaana Tu Aata Nahi, Sapnon Se Jaata Nahi
Darling, you don’t come, nor do you leave my dreams.​

Mil Jaaye Kya Hi Baat Thi, Kaamil Ho Jaata Wahin
If we met, what a thing it would be; I’d become complete right there.​
మనం కలిసితే, అది ఎంత అందమైన విషయం; నేను అక్కడే సంపూర్ణమవుతాను. 

Jaana Mere Sawalon Ka Manzar Tu
Darling, you are the scene of all my questions.​


Haan Main Sukha Sa, Saara Samandar Tu
Yes, I’m a dried-up ocean, and you are its entirety.​
అవును, నేను ఎండిపోయిన సముద్రం, మరియు మీరు దాని సంపూర్ణత.


Kaati Kitni Thi Raatein, Nahi Soya Main
I spent so many nights awake, unable to sleep.​

Tujhko Kitna Bulaya, Phir Roya Main
I called out to you so much, then I wept.​


Teri Saari Woh Baatein, Kyun Sone Nahi Deti
Why don’t all those words of yours let me sleep?​


Sataye Mujhe Haan, Phir Khoya Main
They torment me, yes, and then I lose myself again.​


Sambhal Ke Rakha Woh Phool Mera Tu
You carefully kept that flower of mine.​


Meri Shayari Mein Zarur Raha Tu
You were surely present in my poetry.​
 

Jo Aakhon Mein Pyaari Si Duniya Basayi
The lovely world you built in my eyes.​


Woh Duniya Bhi Tha Tu, Woh Lamha Bhi Tha Tu
That world was you, that moment was you.​


Adhoore Se Waade, Adhoori Si Raatein
Half-kept promises, incomplete nights.​


Ab Hisse Mein Dakhil Mere Bas Woh Yaadein
Now all I have left are those memories.​


Rehna Tha Banke Humdum Tera
I was supposed to stay as your companion.​


Aise Jaana Hi Tha, Phir Tu Kyun Thehra
If you had to leave like this, why did you stay?​

Ab Na Maane Mera Dil, Ke Na Tere Kaabil
Now my heart won’t accept that I’m not worthy of you.​


Thi Ek Arzoo Ki Main Kehta Raha
There was a longing I kept expressing.​


Par Tu Aata Nahi, Sapnon Se Jaata Nahi
But you don’t come, nor do you leave my dreams.​


Mil Jaaye Kya Hi Baat Thi, Kaamil Ho Jaata Wahin
If we met, what a thing it would be; I’d become complete right there.​


Jo Bhi Ho Raaz Tera, Mujhko Batata Nahi
Whatever your secret is, you don’t tell me.​


Mil Jaaye Kya Hi Baat Thi, Kaamil Ho Jaata Wahin
If we met, what a thing it would be; I’d become complete right there.
